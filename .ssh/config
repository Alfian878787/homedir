# Hint.  To successfully make a "mosh" connection to a ufw-firewalled
# machine to which we can already SSH, run this extra firewall command
# on the server:
#
#     ufw allow 60000:61000/udp

# When SSH cannot set up a -D, -L, or -R port-forward, I would rather
# that it fail and return me to the command line than for it to show me
# that it succeeded in getting a prompt.

ExitOnForwardFailure yes

# Since Amazon instances are transitory and IP addresses get re-used,
# there is no point in SSH remembering their IP address and identity.
# Also, I chronically forget to use "ubuntu" as the username.
