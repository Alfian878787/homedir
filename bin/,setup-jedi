# Install into the current Python environment whichever Python tools and
# packages Emacs needs to support my editing environment.  In the past,
# I simply placed a single dedicated virtualenv under ~/.emacs.d that
# had all of these pieces installed.  But now that I regularly switch
# between Python 2 and Python 3, having a single environment gets me
# into trouble since that virtualenv has to be either Python 2 or Python
# 3 but not both.  So, I install these tools into every local virtualenv
# so that they target the exact version of Python that each project
# uses.
